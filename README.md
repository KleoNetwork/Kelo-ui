# Project Name: Kleo - Decentralized Data Custody Chrome Extension

## About
Kleo is a powerful browser extension designed to democratize data sharing and enable users to have custody of their own data. By leveraging browsing history as the focus area, Kleo ensures that user data is stored locally and only indexed when visiting partner websites.

## What it does
Kleo integrates with partner websites and pre-fills relevant user data from browsing history on its pop-up. Users can easily manage and share these attributes with a single click, similar to managing cookie preferences. By empowering users to have custody of their data, Kleo aligns with the Web3 narrative and eliminates the reliance on centralized servers.

## The Problem
Web3 platforms lack user data, limiting their ability to provide personalized experiences and recommendations.

## The Solution
Kleo allows users to take custody of their data and incentivizes them with tokens in exchange for renting or allowing access to their data. This data exchange and request process, along with token transactions, is facilitated through a smart contract hosted on the Binance Smart Chain (BNB).

## Features and Possibilities
- Rent out your data economy, including browsing history, documents, and images, to others.
- Access browsing experiences of notable individuals like Elon Musk, top researchers, or people with opposing views.
- Earn tokens by renting your data to AI models or web3 social media platforms for exclusive community access gated by NFTs.

## Code Snippet (GitHub)

```python
# This code snippet is an example of the Kleo Chrome extension background script.

// TODO: Add appropriate code for interacting with Binance Smart Chain and the extension's functionality.

// Example function to retrieve browsing history
function getBrowsingHistory() {
  // TODO: Implement logic to fetch browsing history from the browser API
}

// Example function to interact with the smart contract on BNB
function interactWithSmartContract() {
  // TODO: Implement logic to interact with the smart contract using web3 or appropriate libraries
}

// Example event listener to trigger data sharing on partner websites
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message, sender, sendResponse) {
  if (message.action === 'shareData') {
    const browsingHistory = getBrowsingHistory();
    // TODO: Process and send browsing history to the partner website
    // TODO: Trigger smart contract interaction and token transactions
    sendResponse({ success: true });
  }
});
